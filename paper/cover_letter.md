Dear Prof. Jonathan Chase, 

We are grateful for the opportunity to resubmit a revised manuscript for your consideration. 
We have endeavored to incorporate all reviewers' feedback into the manuscript and we feel the attached draft constitutes a significant improvement over the previous version. 
We were impressed by the quality of the reviews; they all were thoughtful, clear, and constructive. 
It is evident that all three reviewers have given a fair and careful consideration to our manuscript. 
We would like to thank them for the truly valuable feedback. 

The reviewers identified major limitations in our previous manuscript version with regards to the terminology, the underlying structural control, and the lack of detail in the presentation of the empirical networks. 
In the current version, we have addressed all these concerns and improved both the robustness of the analysis and the clarity of the concepts. 
Detailed responses to each comment, one by one, are provided in the corresponding section.
