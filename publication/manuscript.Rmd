# Introduction

Networks have used to study the role of species in their community. Most approaches are rooted on the assumption that there is a link between a species centrality and its importanceâ€”its ability to modify the abundance of other species. However, recent studies show that definitions of role based on centrality, although simple, might not be a good proxy for the importance of a species for ecosystem functioning. Here we show that using a control theory can yield novel insights about a species role in the community.


```{r example_network, include = F}
loadd(example_net)
	
base_net <- example_net
	bi_net <- example_net %>%
		keep_largest_component() %>%

	as_net <- example_net %>%
		keep_largest_component() %>%
		bipartite_digraph(type = "weight", weight.type = "asymmetry")
	
	fam <- "Helvetica"
